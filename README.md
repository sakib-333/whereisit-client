# WhereIsIt

## Description

This project is a Lost and Found Website, a platform designed to connect individuals who have lost personal belongings with those who may have found them. Users can report lost items, browse found items, and interact to recover their belongings. Developing this website provides practical experience in building full-stack applications, user authentication, file uploads, database management, and API integration

# Purpose

1. **Reuniting Lost Items with Their Owners:** The primary goal is to help people find their lost belongings and for those who have found items to connect with the rightful owners.

2. **Centralized Platform:** Providing a single, easily accessible place for people to report lost items, search for found items, and claim their property.

3. **Detailed Information:** Allowing users to provide specific descriptions of lost items (type, color, brand, distinguishing features) and found items to increase the chances of a match.

4. **Efficient Communication:** Facilitating communication between those who have lost items and those who have found them, potentially through email.

5. **Community Building:** Fostering a sense of community by encouraging people to help each other find lost items.
